  <title>HTML Practice — Mark, Small, Del, Quote & Image</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>HTML Practice — More Formatting Tags</h1>
  <p>This page helps beginners practice a few more inline and visual HTML elements like <mark>mark</mark>, <small>small</small>, <del>del</del>, <s>strike</s>, and <q>quote</q>. It also shows how to insert an image and write comments inside your code.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Mark tag</h2>
  <p>The <mark>mark</mark> tag highlights text as if it was highlighted with a marker pen. Use it to draw attention to important parts of a sentence.</p>
  <p>Example: HTML is <mark>fun</mark> to learn when you practice regularly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Small text</h2>
  <p>The <small>small</small> tag displays text in a smaller size, usually for side notes or fine print.</p>
  <p>Example: <small>This is a tiny note under the paragraph.</small></p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Deleted and Strikethrough text</h2>
  <p>The <del>deleted</del> tag shows content that has been removed, while the <s>strike</s> tag just visually crosses out text without implying deletion.</p>
  <p>Example: The old price was <del>$50</del> but now it's <strong>$35</strong>. Or just show something no longer valid: <s>Outdated info</s>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>
  <p>Use <q>quote</q> for short inline quotations inside text, and <blockquote> for longer quotes that deserve their own block of text.</p>
  <p>Inline quote example: My teacher said, <q>Practice makes progress.</q></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Long quote example: HTML gives structure to your content. The more you write, the clearer it becomes that good structure is like good grammar — invisible when done right.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <hr>

  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>Comments in HTML are notes that appear in the code but not on the page. They help you remember what each part does.</p>
  <p>Example (view it in the source code):</p>
  <p><code>&lt;!-- This is a comment. It won't show up in the browser. --&gt;</code></p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Inserting images</h2>
  <p>Use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to insert an image. It needs at least two attributes: <strong>src</strong> (source of the image file) and <strong>alt</strong> (a short description for accessibility).</p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <p><code>&lt;img src="flower.jpg" alt="A red flower" width="300"&gt;</code></p>
  <p>If you have an image named <strong>flower.jpg</strong> in the same folder, it will appear below:</p>
  <img src="flower.jpg" alt="A red flower" width="300">
  <hr>

  <h2>Practice section</h2>
  <p>1. Add a sentence where you use the <mark>mark</mark>, <small>small</small>, and <q>quote</q> tags together.</p>
  <p>2. Create your own line with a <del>deleted</del> word and a <s>strikethrough</s> word.</p>
  <p>3. Insert an image of your choice (make sure the file is in the same folder). Write a meaningful <strong>alt</strong> description.</p>
  <p>4. Add one HTML comment above your image describing what it shows.</p>
  <p>5. Try editing the text to see how each tag changes the look of your content.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>Finish line</h2>
  <p>You’ve now practiced: &lt;mark&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;del&gt;, &lt;s&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;!-- comments --&gt;. Save and refresh your file to see how each works.</p>
